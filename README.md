# NetPractice

A networking project focused on understanding and practicing TCP/IP addressing. This project is part of the 42 school curriculum.

## Description

This project is a general practical exercise to discover networking. It involves configuring small-scale networks and understanding core networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.

## Learning Objectives

The project covers:
- Understanding IP addresses (IPv4)
- Subnet masks and subnetting
- Network classes (A, B, C)
- Private and public IP ranges
- Network routing
- TCP/IP protocols
- Network switches and routers
- Network interface configuration

## Levels Overview

The project consists of 10 levels, each focusing on different networking concepts:

### Level 1
- Basic IP addressing
- Understanding network interfaces

### Level 2
- Connecting two computers
- Direct communication setup

### Level 3
- Subnet masks
- Network identification

### Level 4
- Understanding routing
- Gateway configuration

### Level 5
- Multiple networks
- Routing between networks

### Level 6
- Complex routing scenarios
- Multiple possible solutions

### Level 7
- Overlapping networks
- Efficient routing paths

### Level 8
- Advanced routing
- Network optimization

### Level 9
- Multiple routers
- Route selection

### Level 10
- Complex network topology
- All concepts combined

## Key Concepts

### IP Addressing
- IPv4 format (32 bits)
- Network and host portions
- Subnet mask usage
- CIDR notation

### Subnetting
- Network subdivision
- Subnet calculation
- Host range determination
- Broadcast address identification

### Routing
- Default gateway
- Routing tables
- Next hop concept
- Route selection

### Network Rules
- Private IP ranges:
  - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
- Reserved addresses
- Network/Broadcast addresses

## Tips for Success
- Always verify network/host portions
- Check for address conflicts
- Ensure proper subnet mask selection
- Verify routing table entries
- Consider network efficiency
- Test connectivity paths

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Overlapping networks
- Invalid IP addresses
- Incorrect subnet masks
- Missing routes
- Improper gateway configuration
- Network/Broadcast address usage
